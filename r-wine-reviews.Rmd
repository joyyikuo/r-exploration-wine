## Overview

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
wine150 <- read.csv("winemag-data_first150k.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
list <- strsplit(as.character(wine150$description), " ")
byword <- data.frame(X = rep(wine150$X, sapply(list, length)), words = unlist(list))
byword$words <- as.character(byword$words)

byword <- filter(byword,!grepl("\\,|\\.",words))

rm_list <- c("^the$","^and$","^is$","^was$","^are$","^were$","^it$","^to$","^by$","^has$","^have$","^of$","^do$","^does$","^in$","^on$","^a$","^an$","^but$","^from$","^his$","^her$","^this$","^with$","^that$","^for$","^made$","^along$","^while$","^still$","^through$","^as$","^which$","^come$","^note$","^even$","^opens$","^it's$","^got$","^its$","^Drink$","^enjoy$","^at$","^seems$","^all$","^wine$","^hints$","^among$","^you'll$","^find$","^offer$","^include$","^years$","^over$","^start$","^finish$","^or$","^if$","^into$","^too$","^not$","^here$","^these$", "^flavors$", "^aromas$", "^palate$","^notes$","^will$","^be$","^bit$","^good$","^some$","^very$","^more$","^bit$","^more$","^little$","^shows$","^so$","^you$","^than$")

byword_f <- filter(byword, !grepl(paste(rm_list, collapse = "|"),words,ignore.case = TRUE))
byword_f$factorwords <- as.factor(byword_f$words)

counts <- 
byword_f %>%
  group_by(factorwords) %>%
  summarise(count = length(factorwords)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

```


```{r}
variety_10 <- wine150 %>%
  group_by(variety) %>%
  summarise(count = length(variety)) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  top_n(10,count)

variety_10 <- wine150 %>%
  filter(variety %in% variety_10$variety) %>%
  select(X,variety) %>%
  right_join(y = variety_10, by = "variety")

variety_10 <- left_join(x = variety_10, y = byword_f, by = "X")
variety_words <- data_frame()

dist_variety <- unique(variety_10$variety)

for(i in 1:length(dist_variety)){
  variety_temp <- variety_10 %>%
    filter(variety == dist_variety[i]) %>%
    group_by(factorwords) %>%
    summarise(count_words = length(factorwords)) %>%
    arrange(desc(count_words)) %>%
    top_n(30, count_words)
  
  variety_temp$variety <- rep(dist_variety[i], times = 30)
  
  variety_words <- bind_rows(variety_words, variety_temp)
}
  variety_words
  
  word_graph <- variety_words %>%
    select(variety,factorwords) %>%
    graph.data.frame(directed = TRUE)
  
  ggraph(word_graph, layout = 'fr') + 
    geom_edge_fan(alpha = 0.5) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name)) 
    

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
